Aim :- To understand what is backend and frontend?
Frontend is the part where we decide how an application will look a like.
Frontend has server from where two way communication is being done between server and device.

What is the job of Frontend server?
-> When a user enters his/her details while login to the application so that details send to this frontend server.
But now the issue is this matching details of user is not done by frontend server, this role is done by backend server.
Backend server is the brain of entire web application which helps frontend server for matching the login details.

when Frontend server provides the details to backend server then backend server have to check those details and match with details that has been stored by it in a place called "Database".

The code written in frontend server is with the help of "react".
The code written in backend server is with the help of "Node + Express".
The code written in Database is with the help of "MongoDB".

The architecture will be look like:-
User laptop<---> Frontend Server<---> Backend Server <---->Database.
