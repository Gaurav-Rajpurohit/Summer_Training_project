In this lecture there are some discussion on MERN.
First, Install Nodejs Windows Installer, and after installation check whether it is installed or not for checking purpose, Go to command Prompt terminal and write "node -v".and after that I got this reply from command Prompt "v18.16.0".Then write npm -v on command prompt and I got reply "9.5.1".

Now, Download the Visual Studion code from chrome.

Thank you
